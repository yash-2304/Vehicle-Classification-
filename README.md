**Project Title:**Development of a Machine Learning Pipeline for Image Classification Using AWS SageMaker

**Objective:**The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning pipeline using AWS SageMaker, specifically for the task of image classification. The pipeline will utilize cloud-based resources and built-in algorithms to classify images into predefined categories.

**Image Classification Task**:The project will focus on categorizing urban vehicle images into specific classes. The classes will include:

*   **Cars**
    
*   **Buses**
    
*   **Trucks**
    
*   **Motorcycles**
    

**Scope of Work**: To keep the project limited and focused, the following decisions have been made:

*   **Data Source**: The dataset will be sourced from publicly available urban vehicle image datasets, such as the [Stanford Cars Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html), which provides a wide range of vehicle types and annotations for classification tasks.
    
*   **Narrowed Focus**: The classification will focus on identifying different types of vehicles found in urban settings. This focus ensures the project remains within a reasonable scope while addressing real-world classification problems.
    
*   **Evaluation**: The project will evaluate pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or AWS SageMaker’s built-in image classification algorithms) and their performance on the dataset. The evaluation will focus on accuracy, training time, and inference time.
    

**Expected Outcomes**:The outcomes of the project will include:

1.  A comparison of different image classification models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and speed of inference.
    
2.  Insights into the scalability and efficiency of AWS SageMaker’s image classification capabilities when applied to large datasets.
    
3.  Recommendations for further improvement or tuning of the classification model for urban vehicle categorization tasks.
